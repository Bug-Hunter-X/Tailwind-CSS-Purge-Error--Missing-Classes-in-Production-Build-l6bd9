# Tailwind CSS Purge Error: Missing Classes in Production Build

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS where the purge process removes necessary CSS classes, resulting in missing styles in the production build. This is particularly likely to occur with complex component structures or dynamic class generation.

## Bug Description

The bug arises when Tailwind's purge process fails to identify all necessary CSS classes due to the complexity of the component structure or dynamic class generation. This leads to missing styles in the production build, breaking the layout and functionality.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run build`.
4. Observe the missing styles in the production build.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing the component structure and purge options in your `tailwind.config.js` file. Consider the following strategies:

*   Simplify complex component structures.
*   Ensure that all dynamic classes are properly identified by Tailwind's purge process. Consider using the `safelist` option in `tailwind.config.js` to explicitly include any potentially problematic classes.
*   Check for any errors during the build process, as they may offer additional clues about missing classes.

This repository provides a clear example of the issue and a solution. It serves as a reference for developers encountering similar problems in their Tailwind CSS projects.
